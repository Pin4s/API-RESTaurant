# Order Manager - Backend Project

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in backend development with Node.js, TypeScript, and SQL.

It was originally based on a guided course, but I followed a practice of:
- Taking notes while watching the content
- Writing all code manually without copy-pasting
- Refactoring and debugging independently

Despite the initial base being taught, I actively built, broke, and fixed the project myself, which helped solidify my understanding of backend fundamentals.

## ðŸ§ª API Testing

This project includes an Insomnia workspace (`insomnia_export.yaml`) with all the main API routes:

- Create Orders
- List Orders by Session
- Create Sessions
- Close Sessions

To use:
1. Import the file into Insomnia (or compatible REST client)
2. Set the base URL (e.g. http://localhost:3333)
3. Start testing!
